I am now a first year academic master student in [THUCoAI group](http://coai.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Department of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn) in Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. My supervisor is Prof. [Minlie Huang](http://coai.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/hml/). My major research interests are about conversational system and reinforcement learning.
